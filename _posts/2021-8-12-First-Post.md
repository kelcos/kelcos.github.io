### This is a good ol standard header

_**This is some fancy bold and italicized text!**_

This is a list of some random things about me:  
+ I like pangolins and tarantulas.  
+ I don't know how to code much.  *Yet?*  
+ I jumped out of a plane.  Twice :)  
+ Pollinators are my jam.  
+ Dark chocolate daily. Minimum.  

This is a numbered list of some plants in my pollinator garden:  
1. mountain mint  
2. asters  
3. yarrow  
4. echinacea  
5. bee balm  
6. etc. infinity
