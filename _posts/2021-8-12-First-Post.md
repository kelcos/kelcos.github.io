### This is a good ol standard header

_**This is some fancy bold and italicized text!**_

This is a list of some random things about me:  
+ I like pangolins and tarantulas.
+ I don't know how to code much.  *Yet?*
+ I jumped out of a plane.  Twice :)
+ Pollinators are my jam.
+ Dark chocolate daily. Minimum.
